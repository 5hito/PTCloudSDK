We may also use this technology to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may receive reports from our partners (e.g. Google Analytics) providing us with this collected information on an individual and aggregated basis based on your use of our Services. You can control the user of certain cookies at the individual browser value. Please review your browser or device setting for more information. If you reject cookies, you may still use our website and Services, but your ability to use some features may be limited.

For example, if you create or log into your account through a social media site, we will have access to certain information from that site, such as your name, account information, profile picture, phone number, email address, gender, date of birth, and friends list. We may process, use, combine, disclose, and retain such information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
